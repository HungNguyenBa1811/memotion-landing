Subject: A full-length, scrolling desktop landing page design for an AI-powered elderly rehabilitation app.

Overall Aesthetic: Modern, clean UI with rounded corners, subtle glassmorphism effects on UI cards, ample white space (using color #FAFAF5), and high-quality, warm photography blended with technical data visualizations. Typography should be clean sans-serif, highly readable for older eyes but modern.

## Main sections:

Section 1: The Hero (Above the Fold)

Layout: Split screen or large hero image with overlay text.

Visuals: A heartwarming, high-quality photo of an elderly person smiling while holding a tablet, with a younger caregiver assisting them. On the tablet screen, show a glowing, simplified UI of a progress chart.

Section 2: Trust Indicators & Ownership

Visuals: A subtle horizontal strip below the hero.

Content: Logos of credible partners (e.g., "Backed by Geriatric Experts," "Used in leading physio centers"). Small text indicating "Developed by medical specialists and AI engineers."

Section 3: Core Technology Showcase (The "How" - Crucial Section) Use a 2x2 grid layout or zigzag layout to showcase the 4 key features with distinct UI visualizations.

Feature 1: AI Personalization (The Roadmap)

Headline: Your Unique Path to Recovery.

Visual: A UI mockup of a dynamic timeline. Show data icons (scanning medical records) flowing into a central AI brain icon, generating a clean, color-coded weekly schedule (e.g., "Week 1: Mobility Basics," "Week 2: Strength Building") using the teal palette (#00695C, #4DB6AC).

Feature 2: Real-time Correction (AI Multimodal)

Headline: Professional Guidance in Your Living Room.

Visual (Most important technical visual): A split view or overlay. On one side, an elderly user is doing a leg lift in front of a phone camera. An augmented reality (AR) skeletal tracking overlay (using bright green lines for correct posture, coral #D87659 for necessary corrections) is projected onto them. A floating UI bubble shows a voice assistant icon saying: "Lift your knee slightly higher to hit the target angle."

Feature 3: Gait Analysis (3D MOCAP)

Headline: Detecting Issues Before They Become Falls.

Visual: A stylized, futuristic 3D wireframe model of a senior walking. Heatmaps or data points glow on joints where abnormalities are detected (e.g., a red glow on an ankle). Text overlay: "Powered by clinical 3D MOCAP Datasets."

Feature 4: Smart Recommendations (ML System)

Headline: Holistic Health: Nutrition & Activity.

Visual: Two clean UI cards side-by-side. One shows a healthy, appetizing meal suggestion personalized for recovery. The other shows a gentle "active recovery" exercise suggestion. Both labeled "ML Recommended."

Section 4: Mission & Message (The Emotional Core)

Section 5: The Team & Ownership (Credibility)

Headline: Built by Experts in Medicine & AI.

Visual: A clean row of 3-4 professional headshots (a Doctor/Geriatrician, a Lead AI Engineer, a Physiotherapist). Underneath each name, their title and a small logo indicating their expertise (e.g., a university or hospital logo). This establishes ownership and clinical validity.

Section 6: Final CTA & Footer

Visual: Strong call to action block with the accent coral color (#D87659) background. Headline: "Ready to transform the recovery experience?" Buttons for App Store and Google Play.

Footer: Clean, dark green background (#00695C) with links to Privacy Policy, Clinical Data Studies, Contact Support.
